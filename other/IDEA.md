# Wei - AI Agentic Habit Tracker

## Thoughts:

i will be building real time gamified ai agentic app for physical well being. a.k.a. Habit Tracker.
It’s like virtual partner that talks to you and gives feedbacks, insights suggestions in realtime

If I can it will be made with real time video streaming support. 
it feels like a real partner.

## Example scenario:

I just wake up . Take my phone. And saying: “ hey, wassap Wei!”. 
She (ai agent) replies: “ hi, dear! How did you slept today? Anything I can help you with?”.
Then I will say: “ not bad, what our plans for today?”
She says: “ nice, I can see that you look cool today. For the beginning let’s do some stretches , push ups, sit-ups, . We need energy for the whole upcoming day. Ahaha.“.

I put my phone in front of me, and start doing ‘push ups’. 
AI agent starts: “oh. U already started? That’s cool buddy”. (Ps: ai agent can start conversations by themselves. autonomous).
Me: “of course, don’t think. Just do it!”.

[...after few minutes...]

Me: “huh, I think it’s done..“ 
Ai agent (she): “ wow, you just earner 5 points. I am adding them now. So... in total you just got 40 points. Nice progress for the past 3 days of Changing your habit and being better version of yourself!!! Congrats my buddy!!”. (Ps: ai agent had access to everything including user history, and data).
Me: “haha, I’m cool boy, WEI !”.
Ai agent: “yeah, I can see it.”.

[... conversation continues and continues...] 

It’s like talking to real partner or in other words very close person for example girlfriend and living the good life and being better version of yourself.

notes: agent do not have any body or face.

We will be using indexedDB for storing the data.

We should define the specific points for each activity. did. check the `app/agentConfigs/activity-list-points.ts` file.

Slick UI/UX.
Different colored badges for different activities.
We'll be using shadcn/ui for the design.
