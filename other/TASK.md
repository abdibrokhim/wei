## [Task]: 
World Health Day Hackathon: The Economics of a Better LiFE Balance 

Your Mission Create an app that turns life choices into a personal economy system. Make it simple enough to use daily but smart enough to drive real behavior change, where good habits literally "pay off" with earned points that can be spent on rewards. ðŸ›  Challenge Build a system where: â€¢ Good habits earn points (morning routines, exercise, focused work) â€¢ Points can be spent on rewards (entertainment, treats, breaks) â€¢ The system encourages sustainable behavior change 

Bonus Tracks (Choose 1+ to Implement) 
â€¢ "Chain Reaction" Rewards - Link activities for bonus points 
â€¢ "Progressive Load" System - Points adapt as you improve 
â€¢ "Know Thyself" Wizard - Smart setup that calibrates your personal economy 
â€¢ "Goal Gradient" System - Points scale with progress 
â€¢ "Time Context" Engine - Smart timing for activities

The Core Idea
Imagine your life asÂ aÂ personal economy where every choice has real, measurable value:
Total: 11 points earned before breakfast
â—‰ â—‰ â—‰
â—‰ â—‰
â—‰
â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰
â¬† earn points

Wake up at 7 AM
10 minutes meditation
Make your bed
Morning run
30 minutes focused work
Complete a difficult task
Help a colleague
â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰
â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰ â—‰
â—‰ â—‰ â—‰
Study/Work Session:
Morning Routine Example:
Then use these points for rewards:

1 hour of gaming
Social media break
Order takeout
â¬‡ costs 15 points
â¬‡ costs 5 points
â¬‡ costs 25 points

Why Points Matter
Think about it: You wake up, earn 11 points through your morning routine, spend 5Â onÂ aÂ social media break, earn 8Â more through focused workâ€¦ Suddenly, your daily choices become aÂ strategic game where good habits literally "pay off"
Doesnâ€™t drive real change
RESULT?
â€¢	4 points for studying 1 hour
	â€¢	-4 points for gaming 1 hour
CURRENTLY
Regular point systems might give:

Reverse this ratio
GOAL

Building aÂ simple point tracker? Easy. Creating aÂ system that actually changes behavior? Thatâ€™s where itÂ gets interesting:
Real-World Example
The Real Challenge
â€¢	Different starting points (beginner vs expert)
	â€¢	Personal goals (study more vs exercise more)
	â€¢	Human psychology (immediate vs delayed rewards)

We need smarter systems that understand the following:
Create anÂ app that turns this concept into reality. Make itÂ simple enough toÂ use daily but smart enough toÂ drive real behavior change.
